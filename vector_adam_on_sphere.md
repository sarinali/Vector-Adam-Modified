# Vector Adam Variant, Optimizing on a Sphere

Sarina Li

## Problem 

Vector Adam, initially built on top of the ADAM optimization for neural networks has been observed to have issues with vectors. As a result, a variant (VectorAdam) was introduced. 

Now imagine, let $a$ and $b$ be some aribtrary points on a sphere $S$. The goal is to use a variant of Vector Adam so that any arbitrary point $n$ on the sphere can be optimized while staying on the sphere.

## Progress

### May 22nd, 2024

I began this exploratory project on May 22nd 2024. I set up the repository and code environment. I also ran a couple runs of the initial VectorAdam demo code to understand what it was trying to do. 

On this day, I also played around with the code and created a simulation using VectorAdam to optimize for the least distance between two points.
